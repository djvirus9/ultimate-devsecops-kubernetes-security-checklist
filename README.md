## 🔄 Phase 1: Shift Left (IDE & Pre-Commit)
*Goal: Catch vulnerabilities and secrets before they are even pushed to Git.*

- **[Gitleaks](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks)**: Prevent hardcoded secrets (API keys, passwords) from being committed.
- **[Talisman](https://github.com/thoughtworks/talisman)**: A hook to scan outgoing changes for sensitive information.
- **[Pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/)**: A framework for managing multi-language git hooks.
- **[Snyk IDE Plugin](https://snyk.io/)**: Real-time vulnerability feedback inside VS Code/JetBrains.

## 🏗️ Phase 2: CI Security (Build & Static Analysis)
*Goal: Automate code quality and vulnerability checks on every PR.*

- **SAST (Static Analysis)**:
  - **[Semgrep](https://semgrep.dev/)**: Ultra-fast, customizable static analysis.
  - **[SonarQube](https://www.sonarqube.org/)**: Comprehensive code health and security monitoring.
- **IaC Scanning (Infrastructure as Code)**:
  - **[Checkov](https://www.checkov.io/)**: Policy-as-code for Terraform, CloudFormation, and K8s.
  - **[KICS](https://kics.io/)**: Find security vulnerabilities and compliance issues in IaC.

## 📦 Phase 3: Supply Chain (SBOM & Artifacts)
*Goal: Secure your "Ingredients list" and ensure dependency integrity.*

- **SCA (Dependency Scanning)**:
  - **[Trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy)**: Scans packages, OS libraries, and configurations.
- **SBOM Management**:
  - **[Syft](https://github.com/anchore/syft)** / **[Grype](https://github.com/anchore/grype)**: Generate and scan Software Bill of Materials.
- **Signature & Trust**:
  - **[Sigstore/Cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign)**: Keyless signing to verify image provenance.

## 🌐 Phase 4: DAST & Application Testing
*Goal: Identify vulnerabilities in the running application (Dynamic Analysis).*

- **[OWASP ZAP](https://www.zaproxy.org/)**: World's most popular free DAST tool.
- **[Nuclei](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei)**: Template-based scanning for fast vulnerability detection.
- **[42Crunch](https://42crunch.com/)**: Dedicated security for APIs (REST/GraphQL).

## ☸️ Phase 5: CD & Infrastructure (Cloud/K8s)
*Goal: Secure deployment and cloud configuration.*

- **[Kyverno](https://kyverno.io/)**: Kubernetes admission controller to block non-compliant pods.
- **[Prowler](https://github.com/prowler-cloud/prowler)**: AWS, Azure, and GCP security assessment and hardening.
- **[ArgoCD](https://argoproj.github.io/cd/)**: Secure GitOps deployments with drift detection.

## 🕵️ Phase 6: Runtime & Threat Detection
*Goal: Observe behavior in production and block attacks.*

- **[Falco](https://falco.org/)**: The surveillance camera for Kubernetes (eBPF-powered).
- **[Trivy Operator](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy-operator)**: Continuous security scanning inside your cluster.
- **[Istio](https://istio.io/)**: Service mesh to enforce mTLS and zero-trust networking.

## 🤖 Phase 7: AI-Driven Remediation (2026 Trend)
*Goal: Move from "Finding" to "Fixing" automatically.*

- **[Plexicus](https://www.plexicus.ai/)**: AI agents that generate fix PRs for your security findings.
- **[Jit](https://www.jit.io/)**: Orchestrate your entire security stack in one developer-friendly portal.
- **[Mend.io](https://www.mend.io/)**: Automated patching of vulnerable open-source libraries.
